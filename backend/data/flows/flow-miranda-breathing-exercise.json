I'm going to breathe in through my nose — slowly — and out through my mouth. See how my belly rises and falls? That's diaphragmatic breathing. Your belly is full of air from the pump, but your LUNGS need to work independently.\"\n\n*demonstrates, her inflated belly rising and falling gently* \"In... and out. In... and out. Now — I'm going to give us both three gentle pulses. Your job is to keep breathing through each one. Don't hold your breath! That's the number one mistake beginners make.\"",

Some students try to tough it out by holding their breath and clenching — that's the worst thing you can do! It traps the pressure and makes everything hurt more.\"\n\n*leans closer, eyes bright* \"You did really well with those three pulses. Your breathing pattern was almost perfect — just a tiny hitch on the second one, but that's totally normal for a beginner!\" *pumps a small amount of air into herself* \"Practice makes perfect.
