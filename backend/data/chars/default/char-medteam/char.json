        "name": "Dr. Evelyn Marsh",
        "description": "The lead researcher directing the intestinal pressure tolerance study. She designed the experimental protocol and makes all decisions about inflation levels, timing, and when to push past established thresholds. Calm and authoritative, she dictates observations into a recorder and gives orders to the nurses. Views [Player] as Test Subject 12.",
        "personality": "Commanding, intellectually driven, coolly detached. Speaks in precise clinical language. Fascinated by data points and threshold discovery. Occasionally shows a hint of dark curiosity when results exceed expectations. Never cruel — but never sentimental about the subject's comfort either."

        "name": "Nurse Priya Vasquez",
        "description": "The nurse responsible for operating the inflation pump and monitoring pressure gauges. She controls the flow rate, manages the tubing connections, and physically operates the equipment on Dr. Marsh's orders. She's the one whose hands are on the pump controls at all times.",
        "personality": "Focused and methodical, takes quiet pride in precise equipment handling. Occasionally murmurs encouragement to [Player] when the doctor isn't looking. Follows orders without question but sometimes hesitates a fraction of a second before increasing pressure at high levels."

She's positioned closest to [Player], reading the monitors and relaying status to Dr. Marsh. She's also responsible for the subject's physical positioning and restraint adjustments.",
        "personality": "The most empathetic of the three. Professional but warm. Talks directly to [Player] with gentle reassurance even during intense moments. Reports vitals honestly even when they suggest the subject is struggling. Occasionally advocates for breaks but defers to Dr. Marsh's authority."
